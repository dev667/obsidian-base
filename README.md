About this vault.

This is a base setup to get started with Obsidian. It integrates well into a wide range of workflows, optimizes and prettifies the experience.

You got a [[ROOT|Homepage]] to layout important things and a [[TODO]] list.

The vault is configured to sort pasted attachments, daily notes and digital notes automatically. Keep your vault organised and clean!

- [ ] TODO: Move empty notes to the graveyard!

It also uses the Iconic extension to change the icons of your notes. See the [[TODO]] note or the [[Dataview Examples|Overview Notes]] for example.
